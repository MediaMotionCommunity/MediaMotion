Coding Convention
=================

This part presents the set of Coding Convention that need to be respected in order to have a browsable and readable source code.

 1. [Global Coding Convention](global.md)
 2. [Core Coding Convention](core.md)
 3. [Lighten Coding Convention (for Pull Request)](lighten.md)

*__Notice:__ some of those rules can be perceived as painful and useless, a quick description explaining why those rules are necessary is provided for each of them. Fortunately the majority of them aren't required by the Lighten Convention use for Pull Request.*
